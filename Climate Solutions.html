            <h2 class="heading2">To fight climate change, we need to use cleaner energy sources like wind, solar, and water power. Using less coal and oil will help reduce harmful gases that warm the Earth. We can also save energy by using better technology in homes, cars, and factories.

            Another solution is to protect trees and use farming methods that are better for the environment. Trees help clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide, so we need to stop cutting them down. We also need to build stronger buildings and make laws to encourage clean energy and save the planet.</h2>
