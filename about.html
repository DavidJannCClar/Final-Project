                <h2>Climate change is caused by human actions like burning fossil fuels and cutting trees, which raise the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This leads to problems for farms and livestock, rising sea levels, stronger storms, and global warming. It also affects people's health and safety, especially those in high-risk areas.</h2>
                <p>We need to use cleaner energy and reduce emissions to fight climate change. To be prepared for any developments, we must protect neighborhoods and strengthen our infrastructure. The international community must work together to build a brighter future for all.</p>
